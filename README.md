# VGA Driver

VGA driver logic for use with Arty A7 FPGA and PmodVGA breakout. This implementation is independent of the digilaent sample project.

## Functionality

Current commit is an upload of an older implementation, it drives a 1280x1024 VGA display with a block colour and very basic text shapes, mostly a test to make sure everything works as expected.

Also using this as a test for adding in memory interfacing.
